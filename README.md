A small and simple counter in vanilla HTML/JS, which I made for a school assessment.\
I don't really have a good name for it, and I'm not sure it deserves one.\
check it out at [robomobius.com/counter](robomobius.com/counter).\
The fonts won't work properly because they are on my website, but if you can be bothered to change it I'd be fine with that. It's robomobius.com\
